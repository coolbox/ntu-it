Each panellist will be given a maximum of 10 minutes in which to talk about their role within the IT industry/roles within their organisation that don’t necessarily require an IT background.  Some suggestions for topics are below, but please do not feel you need to use these:
Introduction to you and your role
What your organisation does
How you got into your current role (please feel free to talk about your own degree and career history)
The main skills that your sector looks for from a non-IT graduate
Challenges students may face on getting into the field
Any advice you may have for students considering this as a career area
 
I hope that the above all works with you.  If you do have any questions in the meantime please do not hesitate to contact me on either this e-mail or my direct line number 0115 848 3172.  Are you able to forward this to Pete Roome?  Alternatively I’m happy to if you have his contact details.
 
Once again many thanks for your help and support with this event.  Have a good weekend and I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.
 
Best Wishes,
